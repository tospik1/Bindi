# This is a simple app that helps you to manage the time, record, and understand how you fill your time. Change your understanding of time and become conscious of it. Know the value of your time and move with it, balance your life and improve it.
I made this app to help my friend who is currently enrolled in UAL: University of Arts London and pursuing a master's degree.
Notes: 
-Since it is a demo to demonstrate my friend's idea, I did not implement the persistence layer. 
-Testing with an iphone 8 during the demonstration. 
-This app will not be published and its purpose is showing a creative idea thus I did not implement constraints to the UI.
